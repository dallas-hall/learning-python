# Python

Me learning Python, currently with [Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) for 30 minutes a day. I have wrote some scripts that I haven't upload yet, will do that soon enough. The scripts are parsing text files and doing some database loads. It also contains my first web scraping script, which I used to download about 100 files automagically.
