# Programs To Make
The book suggested writing down 3 things that I want to make.

1. Games. I'd like to make: 
  * 2D side on scrolling shooter.
  * Text or GUI based role playing game that plays itself. 
2. Website.
  * I'd like to build a website using Python as a backend. And use other skills I have such as DevOps and k8s.
3. Automation, I'd like to automate things at work and at home with Python.
