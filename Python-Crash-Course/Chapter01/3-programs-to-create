# Programs To Make
The book suggested writing down 3 things that I want to make.

1. Games - More specifically I'd like to make 2D side on scrolling shooter.
2. Website - I'd like to rebuild my website using Python as the backend.
3. Automation - I'd like to automate things at work with Python, such as REST API calls to administrate Atlassian products.
